For a quick test, open a python interactive session and try this:
>>>import serial
>>>ser = serial.Serial('/dev/ttyUSB0') 

Which would try to open a default 9600 8-N-1 no flow control connection. 
You may then get the error:
serial.serialutil.SerialException: [Errno 13] could not open port /dev/ttyUSB0: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/dev/ttyUSB0'

See here for issues when the python program isn't allowed to connect
to the ttyUSB0 port:
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gtkterm/+bug/949597

sudo apt-get remove modemmanager
 sudo adduser youracct dialout
 su - youracct

If installed, you can try using minicom to talk to the water bath:
 minicom -D /dev/ttyUSB0

Some setup options for minicom: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Minicom
I also recommend using the Add newline option when running minicom, since 
the responses from the waterbath aren't all rendered properly as newlines.
